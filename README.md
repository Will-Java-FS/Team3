# Bistro Management App

## Project Description

The Bistro Application is a comprehensive software solution designed to manage food, orders, reservations, dining tables, and users efficiently. It features role-based functionality, ensuring that the available actions depend on the type of user logged in. With JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication, the app secures sensitive operations, granting permissions based on the userâ€™s role. Customers can log in to place orders and make reservations, while staff members can access and manage data relevant to their tasks.

## Tech Used

- **ReactJS:** For building the dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Node.js/Express:** For backend API and authentication.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For securing endpoints and managing user sessions.
