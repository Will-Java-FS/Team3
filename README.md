# Bistro Management App

## Project Description

The Bistro Management Application is a comprehensive software solution designed to manage various aspects of a bistro, including food, orders, reservations, dining tables, and users. It features role-based functionality, ensuring that available actions depend on the user's role. With JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, the app secures sensitive operations, granting permissions based on the userâ€™s role. Customers can log in to place orders and make reservations, while staff members can access and manage data relevant to their tasks.

## Tech Used

- **ReactJS:** For building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Node.js/Express:** For backend API and authentication.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For securing endpoints and managing user sessions.
