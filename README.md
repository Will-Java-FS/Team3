# Bistro Management App

## Project Overview

The Bistro Management Application is a robust software solution tailored to efficiently manage various aspects of a bistro, including food items, orders, reservations, dining tables, and user roles. The application employs role-based access control, ensuring that user actions are aligned with their rolesâ€”customers and staff members have distinct permissions. With the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, the app secures sensitive operations, allowing customers to place orders and make reservations while enabling staff to manage data pertinent to their responsibilities.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - **ReactJS** - For building a dynamic and interactive user interface.

- **Backend:**
  - **Spring**
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - For securing endpoints and managing user sessions.

## Database Design

The application's database is designed to reflect the different entities and their relationships. Here's the ERD representing the structure:
