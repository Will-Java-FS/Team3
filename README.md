# Bistro Management App
## Project Description
The Bistro Application is a software developed with the purpose of enabling the management of food, orders, reservations, dining tables, and users. It filters out functionality based on the kind of user signed in, and ensures via JWT the current user is authorized to perform changes to sensitive data. By having customers log in and use the interface, they can create orders and reservations for themselves as the staff can view the data and focus on their personal tasks
